Dear All,
I would first like to make it very clear that the purpose of this email is to provide some help. I am neither changing the project specification, nor I am suggesting that you change your implementation, if you have already implemented Katz centrality. The project specification remains the same.
The precise mathematical definition of Katz centrality requires the centrality measure to converge precisely to some value. Since convergence is not guaranteed for all values of alpha, I suggested a simplification where you can compute Katz centrality of each node based on a breadth-first search tree from that node, by iterating V times (where V is the number of nodes in the graph). There is no guarantee that the Katz centrality calculated this way will match exactly with the results I sent you earlier, as those are computed using the mathematically precise definition.
The most important point is to explain your implementation clearly in your report. As I have mentioned above, there is no need to change your implementation due to this mail. The sole purpose of this mail is to make some helpful suggestions. 
best,
Amitava
